# EaseYourLife
# I want to publish the scripts I use in daily life to ease the processes I follow.
# It eases the pain and saves time. Not in the first round maybe. But when you need to do
# repetetive tasks like gathering all e-mail addresses in your Outlook contacts to send 
# a new year greetings, you can save your time with a scripting.
# I hope it saves your time too.
